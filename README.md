# 🏫 AI-Powered School Website

Welcome to the **School Website** project! This is a fully responsive educational platform designed to demonstrate how Artificial Intelligence can assist in modern web development.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project serves as a digital portal for an educational institution. It was built using a collaboration between human creativity and AI efficiency. The goal was to create a clean, accessible, and informative interface for students and parents.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts perfectly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
* **Modern UI:** Clean styling defined in `styles.css`.
* **Interactive Elements:** Dynamic behavior powered by `script.js`.
* **Fast Loading:** Lightweight structure using pure HTML/CSS/JS (no heavy frameworks).

## 🤖 Built with AI
This project highlights the potential of AI in coding workflows:
* **Structure & Logic:** AI tools helped scaffold the `index.html` structure and `script.js` logic.
* **Styling:** CSS layouts and responsive grids were generated and refined with AI assistance.
* **Content:** Placeholder text and sections were drafted using LLMs.
